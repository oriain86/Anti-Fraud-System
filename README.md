# Project: Anti-Fraud Application

## Background

The Anti-Fraud Application is a backend system built using the Spring framework. It is designed to protect financial transactions from fraudulent activities by validating incoming transaction data, detecting anomalies through predefined business rules, and leveraging historical data. Unlike typical social media or blogging APIs that manage user posts and comments, this application focuses on ensuring that each transaction is thoroughly checked against potential fraud indicators. These include verifying the transaction amount, checking the originating IP address against a maintained blacklist, and validating the card number against known stolen cards. Additionally, it incorporates dynamic feedback to adjust its internal thresholds, ensuring that the fraud detection mechanism evolves over time.

## Spring Technical Requirements

This project leverages the full power of the Spring Boot framework to simplify configuration and development. The application is built with Spring MVC for RESTful endpoints, Spring Data JPA for data persistence, and Spring Security for robust authentication and role-based access control. These technologies ensure that the application is modular, scalable, and maintainable, meeting enterprise-level standards for performance and security.

Key Spring components include:
- **Spring Boot**: Provides the core application framework and auto-configuration.
- **Spring MVC**: Facilitates the creation of RESTful endpoints to process transactions and manage fraud data.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database interactions through repository interfaces and entity mappings.
- **Spring Security**: Secures endpoints and manages user authentication and authorization.

## User Stories

1. **Transaction Processing:**  
   As a user, I expect the API to process new transactions by validating the amount, checking the originating IP address against a list of suspicious IPs, and verifying the card number against a list of stolen cards. The system will classify transactions as ALLOWED, MANUAL_PROCESSING, or PROHIBITED based on these checks.

2. **Dynamic Feedback and Limit Adjustment:**  
   As an auditor, I should be able to provide feedback on transactions. If feedback indicates a discrepancy between the initial transaction result and the actual risk, the system will adjust its internal limits accordingly, allowing it to learn and adapt over time.

3. **Suspicious IP Management:**  
   As a support agent, I want to add or remove IP addresses from the suspicious IP list. This ensures that the fraud detection system remains updated with the latest threat intelligence.

4. **Stolen Card Management:**  
   As a support agent, I need to add or remove card numbers from the stolen card list. This prevents fraudulent transactions using compromised cards.

5. **User Management & Security:**  
   As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts by registering new users, changing their roles, and locking or unlocking accounts. This enforces proper access control and ensures that only authorized personnel can perform sensitive operations.

## Summary

The Anti-Fraud Application is a comprehensive backend solution focused on detecting and preventing fraudulent financial transactions. With a strong emphasis on security, data integrity, and dynamic system adjustment through feedback, the application is designed for high-stakes enterprise environments. Leveraging the Spring framework, it combines robust RESTful services with secure, scalable data management. This project demonstrates best practices in modern application development, with a clear separation of concerns and a modular architecture that supports future enhancements and integrations.
